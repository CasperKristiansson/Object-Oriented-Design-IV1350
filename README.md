# IV1350 Object Oriented Design
This course makes you able to implement a given requirement specification in flexible and easily understood code. To reach this goal, the course covers fundamental concepts of object-oriented analysis, design and architecture, such as low coupling, high cohesion, encapsulation and polymorphism. The course also gives hands-on experience in using these concepts to design and implement an object-oriented program.
### Course contents

Examples of fields that are treated:
- Object-oriented design and design pattern  
- Architecture and architectural patterns  
- Guidelines for object-oriented programming for example refactoring and unit testing 
- UML (Unified Modeling Language)  
- Object-oriented analysis
